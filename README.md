# ecological_simulations

This repo (work in progress!) contains various scripts for simulations and data analysis relating to our recent preprint:

[Structured environments fundamentally alter dynamics and stability of ecological communities](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/10/366559)

Simulations are currently written in MATLAB, and data analysis performed in R.  Rewriting the simulation scripts in R is on the to-do list; if this would be useful to anyone sooner rather than later open an issue or email me at nlowery(at)uoregon(dot)edu to let me know.

In general, the simulations write image files and associated metadata, and the R scripts parse that data and generate the figures.  For more specific information, see the header info of each script.
