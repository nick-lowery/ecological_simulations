# ecological_simulations

This repo contains various scripts for simulations and data analysis relating to our recent preprint:

[Structured environments fundamentally alter dynamics and stability of ecological communities](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/10/366559)

Simulations are currently written in MATLAB, and data analysis performed in R.  Rewriting the simulation scripts in R is on the to-do list.

In general, the simulations write image files and associated metadata, and the R scripts parse that data and generate the figures.  For more specific information, see the header info of each script.
